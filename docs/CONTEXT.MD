# GoalGaurd - A Daily Goal Tracker App - Project Requirements Document

## 1. Introduction

The GoalGuard App is an iOS application designed to help users set and achieve daily physical goals—such as reaching 10,000 steps or running a specific distance—while motivating them through a gamified experience. If users do not complete their daily goal, pre-selected apps on their iOS device will be blocked using the Screen Time API until the goal is met. Conversely, users earn rewards and virtual currency (coins) for meeting their goals, building streaks, and tackling bonus challenges. The app leverages HealthKit for automated progress tracking and uses Supabase for backend services.

With the updated tech stack, the app is developed using **React Native with TypeScript, Expo, and Expo Router** for the frontend and **React Native Paper** for UI components. This stack supports a cross-platform approach, though initial focus remains on iOS with deep integrations via native modules when required.

## 2. Features

### 2.1 User Authentication

- **Description:** Users sign up and log in securely to access their personalized experience.
- **Details:**
  - Authentication is handled using **Supabase Auth** integrated with React Native.
  - Each user is assigned a unique ID linking their app data to backend records in Supabase.
- **Key Screens/Components:**
  - **Login/Registration:** Using Supabase Auth for secure authentication.
  - **Dashboard:** Displays current goal status, progress (from HealthKit), streak, and coin balance.

### 2.2 Goal Setting

- **Description:** Users define a single daily physical goal (e.g., 10,000 steps, run 5 kilometers) to complete by the end of each day.
- **Details:**
  - A simple, intuitive UI (built with React Native Paper) allows users to input their daily goal.
  - Only physical goals are supported at launch.
  - Goals reset daily; users are prompted to set a new target each day.
  - Users can select which apps to block via the Screen Time API if the goal is not met.

### 2.3 Progress Tracking

- **Description:** The app monitors progress toward the daily physical goal using HealthKit.
- **Details:**
  - Integration with **HealthKit** is achieved through a combination of Expo modules and custom native modules as necessary.
  - HealthKit permissions are requested upon first use.
  - Real-time progress data (steps, running distance) is displayed on the dashboard.

### 2.4 Blocking Mechanism

- **Description:** If a user fails to meet their daily goal by midnight, the app blocks pre-selected applications on their iOS device the following day until the goal is achieved.
- **Details:**
  - The **Screen Time API** (available on iOS 12+) is used to enforce app blocking.
  - Blocking is activated at 12:00 AM if the previous day's goal is unmet and is lifted once the current day's goal is completed.
  - The app provides clear instructions for users to grant the necessary Screen Time permissions.

### 2.5 Gamification

- **Description:** A gamified system motivates users with rewards, streaks, and (future) social features.
- **Details:**
  - **Currency System:**
    - Users earn coins for completing daily goals (e.g., 10 coins per day).
    - **Streak Bonus:** Additional coins (e.g., +5 coins per day after a 3-day streak).
  - **Rewards Store:**
    - **Skip Day:** 50 coins – Skip a day's goal without breaking the streak.
    - **Streak Saver:** 75 coins – Maintain your streak despite a missed goal.
    - **Goal Reduction:** 30 coins – Temporarily lower the daily goal target.
  - **Bonus Challenges:**
    - Randomly triggered challenges (e.g., "Run 7 km instead of 5 km") awarding extra coins (e.g., +20 coins).
  - **Future Social Features:**
    - A friend system to compare streaks and a leaderboard for competitive motivation.

  - Data encryption in transit and at rest.

### 3.4 Backend Logic

- **Technology:** Supabase Edge Functions (serverless)
- **Core Functions:**
  - **Goal Validation:**
    - Validates if the daily physical goal is met using HealthKit data.
  - **Blocking Status:**
    - A scheduled Edge Function runs at 12:00 AM to check the previous day's goal status and, if unmet, triggers the Screen Time API to block selected apps.
  - **Reward Updates:**
    - Calculates coin earnings, updates streaks, and processes reward redemptions.
  - **Friend System:**
    - (Future feature) Manages friend requests and streak comparisons.

### 3.5 Data Flow

1. **User Authentication:**
   - Users register or log in via Supabase Auth; a unique user ID is available within the Supabase session.
2. **Goal Setting:**
   - Users define their daily physical goal and choose apps to block.
   - Goal data is stored in Supabase.
3. **Progress Tracking:**
   - HealthKit collects physical activity data.
   - Data is sent to Supabase for real-time progress display and validation.
4. **Daily Check at 12:00 AM:**
   - An Edge Function checks if the previous day's goal was met.
   - If the goal is unmet, the Screen Time API is activated to block the chosen apps.
5. **Gamification:**
   - Upon successful goal completion, coins are awarded and streaks are updated.
   - Reward redemptions and bonus challenges are processed via Edge Functions.
