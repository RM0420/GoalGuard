# GoalGuard MVP Release Plan

## From Current State to App Store Launch

---

## **⚠️ CRITICAL: Windows Development Environment Solution**

**PROBLEM**: You're on Windows PC, but iOS development with native modules (HealthKit/Screen Time APIs) requires Xcode, which only runs on macOS.

**SOLUTIONS** (Choose one):

### **Option 1: Cloud-based macOS (Recommended for MVP)**

- **MacStadium**: Professional cloud Mac rentals ($69-129/month)
  - Dedicated Mac mini in the cloud
  - Full Xcode access, fast performance
  - Cancel anytime after MVP completion
- **AWS EC2 Mac Instances**: ($1.083/hour for mac1.metal)
  - Pay only when developing
  - Full macOS environment
- **GitHub Actions + macOS Runners**:
  - Free tier: 2,000 minutes/month
  - Use for builds, but not interactive development

### **Option 2: Physical Mac Purchase**

- **Mac mini M2** (~$599): Most cost-effective option
- **Used/Refurbished Macs**: $300-500 on eBay/Facebook Marketplace
- **Rent-to-own services**: Flex payments for new Macs

### **Option 3: Development Partnership**

- **Hire iOS Developer**: $30-80/hour for native module development
- **Partner with Mac owner**: Split development responsibilities
- **Freelancer platforms**: Upwork, Fiverr for specific iOS tasks

### **Option 4: Hybrid Development Approach**

1. Use **MacStadium** for initial native module development
2. Set up **CI/CD pipeline** for automated builds
3. Continue React Native development on Windows
4. Use cloud Mac only for iOS-specific tasks

### **Option 5: EAS Build (Expo Application Services) - FREE TIER!** 🎯

- **Cost**: FREE tier (30 builds/month) + paid tiers start at $29/month
- **What it does**: Builds iOS apps in the cloud without needing a Mac
- **Perfect for MVP**: You can develop native modules on Windows, build/test via EAS
- **How it works**:
  1. Write native iOS code (Swift/Objective-C) on Windows in text editor
  2. Use EAS Build to compile and generate .ipa files
  3. Test on physical iOS devices via TestFlight
  4. Iterate until working correctly
- **Pros**:
  - ✅ No Mac needed for building
  - ✅ Free tier available
  - ✅ Integrated with Expo workflow
  - ✅ Automatic code signing
  - ✅ Can generate TestFlight builds directly
- **Cons**:
  - ❌ No Xcode debugging (blind development)
  - ❌ Longer feedback loop for native code issues
  - ❌ Build queue times on free tier

### **UPDATED RECOMMENDATION: EAS Build First!**

**Start with EAS Build** because:

1. **FREE** to try (30 builds/month)
2. **No Mac required** for building iOS apps
3. **Perfect for MVP** development approach
4. **Fallback option**: If EAS becomes limiting, then consider MacStadium

**NEW HYBRID APPROACH**:

1. **Develop everything on Windows** (React Native + native modules)
2. **Use EAS Build** for iOS compilation and TestFlight distribution
3. **Only get Mac access** if you hit EAS limitations or need debugging

**UPDATED PHASE 1** will now include setting up cloud macOS access.

## **📱 TestFlight & iOS Testing Explained**

### **TestFlight - Beta Distribution Platform**

**What it is**: Apple's official beta testing service built into App Store Connect

**How it works**:

1. **Upload builds** → App Store Connect (via Xcode or EAS Build)
2. **Apple processes** → Automatic review (~2-24 hours)
3. **Invite testers** → Up to 10,000 external testers via email
4. **Testers install** → TestFlight app → Download your beta
5. **Collect feedback** → Crash reports, feedback, analytics

**For your GoalGuard MVP**:

```
Your Workflow with EAS Build:
┌─────────────┐    ┌─────────────┐    ┌─────────────┐    ┌─────────────┐
│   Code on   │ → │  EAS Build  │ → │ TestFlight  │ → │   Family &  │
│   Windows   │    │  (Cloud)    │    │ Distribution│    │   Friends   │
└─────────────┘    └─────────────┘    └─────────────┘    └─────────────┘
```

**TestFlight Benefits**:

- ✅ **Real device testing** (HealthKit/Screen Time only work on real devices)
- ✅ **Crash reporting** - See exactly where native modules fail
- ✅ **Easy distribution** - Send link, testers get updates automatically
- ✅ **Feedback collection** - Screenshots, comments, device info
- ✅ **No Mac required** - Works perfectly with EAS Build workflow

### **Native Automated iOS Testing (XCTest Framework)**

**What it is**: Apple's testing framework for automated unit/UI tests

**Types of automated tests**:

#### **1. Unit Tests (XCTest)**

```swift
// Example: Test your HealthKit module
import XCTest
@testable import GoalGuard

class HealthKitModuleTests: XCTestCase {
    func testStepCountQuery() {
        let healthKit = HealthKitModule()
        let expectation = XCTestExpectation(description: "Step count fetched")

        healthKit.getStepCount { result in
            XCTAssertNotNil(result)
            XCTAssertGreaterThan(result.steps, 0)
            expectation.fulfill()
        }

        wait(for: [expectation], timeout: 5.0)
    }
}
```

#### **2. Integration Tests**

```swift
// Test HealthKit → React Native bridge
func testHealthKitBridge() {
    // Simulate HealthKit data
    // Verify React Native receives correct format
    // Test error handling for permission denials
}
```

#### **3. UI Tests (XCUITest)**

```swift
// Automated app testing
func testGoalSettingFlow() {
    let app = XCUIApplication()
    app.launch()

    // Navigate to goals screen
    app.tabBars.buttons["Goals"].tap()

    // Set step goal
    app.textFields["stepGoal"].tap()
    app.textFields["stepGoal"].typeText("10000")

    // Verify goal was saved
    XCTAssertEqual(app.textFields["stepGoal"].value as? String, "10000")
}
```

### **Automated Testing Strategy for Your MVP**

#### **What You SHOULD Test (High Priority)**

1. **HealthKit Permission Flow**:

   ```swift
   func testHealthKitPermissions() {
       // Test permission request
       // Test permission denial handling
       // Test data access after permission granted
   }
   ```

2. **Screen Time Permission Flow**:

   ```swift
   func testScreenTimePermissions() {
       // Test Screen Time authorization
       // Test app discovery functionality
       // Test blocking/unblocking apps
   }
   ```

3. **Data Sync Integration**:

   ```swift
   func testHealthKitToSupabaseSync() {
       // Mock HealthKit data
       // Verify Supabase receives correct format
       // Test network failure scenarios
   }
   ```

4. **Goal Completion Logic**:
   ```swift
   func testGoalCompletion() {
       // Simulate reaching step goal
       // Verify gamification triggers (coins, streaks)
       // Test app unblocking
   }
   ```

#### **What You CAN SKIP for MVP**

- Complex UI test suites
- Performance testing
- Extensive edge case testing
- Accessibility testing (initially)

### **Testing Workflow with EAS Build**

#### **Option 1: Cloud Testing (Recommended for MVP)**

```bash
# 1. Write tests on Windows
ios/GoalGuardTests/HealthKitTests.swift

# 2. Configure EAS to run tests
# eas.json
{
  "build": {
    "test": {
      "ios": {
        "buildConfiguration": "Debug",
        "simulator": true,
        "test": {
          "scheme": "GoalGuardTests"
        }
      }
    }
  }
}

# 3. Run tests in cloud
eas build --platform ios --profile test
```

#### **Option 2: TestFlight Manual Testing**

```
Manual Test Checklist for Beta Testers:
□ Install app via TestFlight
□ Grant HealthKit permissions
□ Set daily step goal (e.g., 8000 steps)
□ Walk/exercise to test step tracking
□ Verify goal completion triggers rewards
□ Test Screen Time app blocking
□ Verify app unblocking after goal completion
□ Test streak functionality over multiple days
```

### **How This Works for YOUR Windows Development**

#### **Development Cycle**:

1. **Write tests on Windows** (in text editor/VS Code)
2. **Write native code on Windows**
3. **Commit to git**
4. **Run EAS build with tests** (`eas build --profile test`)
5. **Review test results** in EAS dashboard
6. **Fix issues and repeat**

#### **Beta Testing Cycle**:

1. **EAS build for TestFlight** (`eas build --platform ios`)
2. **Upload to TestFlight** (automatic with EAS)
3. **Invite family/friends**
4. **Collect crash reports and feedback**
5. **Fix critical issues**
6. **Release new TestFlight build**

### **Testing Timeline for Your MVP**
